## About sockets
Web Socket is a protocol which provides a full duplex(multiway) communication i.e allows communication in both directions simultaneously. It is a modern web technology in which there is a continuous connection between the userâ€™s browser(client) and the server. In this type of communication, between the web server and the web browser, both of them can send messages to each other at any point in time.
